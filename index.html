				<p class='top_text'>A solid challenge, a great team and a forward-thinking client. To me, those are the elements which will allow something special to happen. In the past, I have been lucky to work with awesome people on projects, which were truly groundbreaking. Some of those projects are listed below.</p>
				<div class='work_item'>
					<h3>client: <em>QGC</em></h3>
					<div class='teaser'>
						<h4>A beautifully designed suite of e-learning modules designed to explain the workings of a massive plant, which will be the world's first to turn gas from coal seams into LNG.</h4>

						<p>In Gladstone an LNG plant is being built which converts coal seam gas to liquid natural gas. It's never been done before and QGC needs a set of e-learning modules, which will explain the overall functionality to the engineers who will be running the plant.</p>
						<img src='img/screen_qgc_thumb.png' alt='Screenshot of the Deloitte Game'/>
						<p>It is an enormous task, 19 separate modules are to be built and delivery is necessary well before the construction of the plant is finalized, which gives us a total of 4 months.</p>
						<p>Liquid Interactive asks me to lead the project, but <em>not only to lead the team but also to lead the technical solution</em>. I have done several large e-learning projects in the past, but the time constraint is daunting. By keeping the core team as small as possible, with short lines of communication and having the client as a real part of the production team we were very successful.</p>
						<p>The project was delivered on time with modules that are of outstanding quality of which I am extremely proud. The team at Liquid Interactive delivered tremendously. If you want to know more, Liquid Interactive wrote an extensive case which you can read on their website.</p>

					<h3>client: <em>Macquarie University</em></h3>

						<p>Before this project started, Andrew from Liquid Interactive sought my advice on whether a multiplayer game was possible, playable in a browser, with a production budget that included 5 weeks of development time. I told him he was nuts.</p>
						<img src='img/screen_macquarie_thumb.png' alt='Screenshot of the Macquarie Game'/>
						<p>Weeks later, Andrew invites me to a meeting with Mauricio and see whatâ€™s possible. Mauricio represents Macquarie University as the client. He is very enthusiastic and the idea itself is great. We make changes, we discuss ideas and we realise we need a prototype. Not a prototype that needs to be developed itself, but one that takes advantage existing tools to illustrate the core objective.</p>
						<p>The prototype is necessary to see how people would interact with each other and how they would respond to the core mechanics of the game; the stuff that actually matters! The result was very encouraging and interactions were hilarious. The power balance in the game is deliberately skewed to present a situation where some players are put at a distinct disadvantage whilst others are given a superior advantage. All of this happens without any of the players actually knowing about it. This results in overconfident players trading away their monopoly and disadvantaged player using their wit and charm to win the game against all odds.</p>
						<p>For this project I have <em>written all the code</em>, both front and backend. Besides that I was responsible for <em>writing up the specifications</em> and <em>creating the wireframes</em> to easily share and discuss our perspective of user experience to the client. These wireframes were later used to create the final design of the game.</p>
						<p>This game ended up winning an iAward in New South Wales for education. To learn more about this game you can either watch the instructional video from the university itself, or read the extensive case study on the website of Liquid Interactive.</p>

						<p>Back in Amsterdam, Virtual Fairground is given the task to build the front end to a realistic simulation business game. The main gaming interface is to be built and the simulation state itself needs to be represented on a globe representing the separate markets as countries.</p>
						<img src='img/screen_deloitte_thumb.png' alt='Screenshot of the Deloitte Game'/>
						<p>The globe needs to represent the world and markets that the player interacts with. Any decision the player makes will result in countries increasing trade, or other countries losing revenue and becoming unstable. Those changes in state need to be displayed real-time in 3D, playable in the browser. This game was created in 2009 and another requirement was for the game to perform well on a Pentium 4 laptop.</p>
						<p>That's a performance standard, which is ambitious even for that time. To make sure the game performs well but looks good on faster machine, a strategy is implemented which enables or disabled features based on how well the game is performing. Certain animations would be turned on or off, lower resolution textures would be used, and certain buildings not shown.</p>
						<p>For this game I was in charge of <em>programming the code that renders the globe</em> on the screen. I made <em>prototypes</em> and did the final code of <em>concepts such as weather-systems, traffic and civilizations</em>, which were all to be displayed on that globe. I made sure the rendering of models, textures and animations would perform smoothly even on slower machines.</p>
						<p>The game was a lot of fun to work with and a real solid example of what the browser is capable of even on a low performance machine.</p>

					<h2>About</h2>
				</div>
				<div class='content'>
					<p>I love programming, there's certain art and creativity to it, yet I don't consider myself a pure coder. There is a very real disadvantage to restrict yourself like that; you don't get to be involved in other aspects of a project. And I love to contribute from start to finish.</p>
					<p>This is partly the reason why I make very little mention of technologies or programming languages used; I don't believe it matters much. A product should be viewed in a wider context, how it is being used and what it is that is exactly being solved. </p>
					<p>So when someone comes to me with a technical question or suggestion, I always like to step back a bit, try to get the wider picture, and see what the deeper issue is; often the real solution involves rethinking what the actual problem is.</p>
